# A-algorithm-for-8-puzzle
This program was developed and edited on the Texas State University Linux server.
Make sure that the Project2_jbt71.cpp file is in the correct directory before proceeding to the next steps.

Once in the correct directory, compile the code using
g++ -o Proj2 -std=c++11 Project2_jbt71.cpp

After compilation run the program with
./Proj2

The user will be shown the goal state, and both initial states.
From here the user will decide which initial state they would like to proceed with.
Valid answers only include '1' or '2', then hit enter

After the user will be asked which heuristic they would like to use.
The two heuristics are the misplaced tile heuristic and the custom heuristic that I developed
Valid answers only include '1' or '2', then hit enter

To attempt other initial states or Heuristics, the user can run the program again './Proj2' and repeat the process
